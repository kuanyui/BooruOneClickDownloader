* Permission
For paranoid users such as me, these are all used permissions with its usages:
- =tabs=:
  - Watch the URL changing of all tabs, for checking if URL is supported stie, and decide if show / hide =pageAction= button. (=browser.tabs.onUpdated=).
  - Get the URL of current page (=Tab.url= in =pageAction.onClicked=)
  - Redirect to new URL (=tabs.update({url: string})=)
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE 
    [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Differences_between_desktop_and_Android#Effect_on_your_add-on_UI][Firefox for Android requires developer call =browser.pageAction.show()= explicitly]] and it's impossible to use =pageAction= with only =manifest.page_action.show_matches= to implement this extension.
  #+END_QUOTE

- =storage=:
  - For saving user preferences in your Mozilla account (=storage.sync=)

- =startpage.com=
  - =startpage.com= protect privacy in a extremely paranoid way: it's impossible to get query string from URL. Therefore, I have to inserting =content.js= to get query string from =<input>=.
